# ToDoList APP
“ToDoList App is an app that manages a list and stores it away for later retrieval. You can add, modify, and delete items in the list using a custom input screen. Depending on what type of items are on your list, you can choose from various controls to give your users the best possible form of input.
”
“The app you'll build should adhere to these simple specs:
When the app opens, it displays a list of items.
The list screen has controls for adding and deleting items on the list.
Tapping an item displays more details about the item.
The detail screen permits editing.
The app saves the latest version of the list.
